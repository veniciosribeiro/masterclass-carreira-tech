    # API URL should be configured via environment variable if frontend needs it build-time or run-time
    # For SPA + Nginx, we might need to proxy or bake env vars.
    # Currently vite config proxies /api to localhost:4000, which works for local dev.
    # For prod, Nginx usually handles routing or we assume strict separate domains.
